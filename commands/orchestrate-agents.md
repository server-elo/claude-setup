Execute multiple specialized AI agents in parallel for complex development tasks.

**Target Task:** $ARGUMENTS

**Orchestration Patterns:**

### Product Trinity Pattern (3 Agents)
1. **Product Manager** → Requirements analysis and feature specification
2. **Architect** → Technical design and system architecture
3. **QA Engineer** → Test planning and quality assurance

### Full Development Pipeline (5 Agents)
1. **Security Auditor** → Threat modeling and security requirements
2. **Database Architect** → Data model and schema design
3. **Frontend Architect** → UI/UX design and component planning
4. **DevOps Engineer** → Infrastructure and deployment strategy
5. **Performance Engineer** → Scalability and optimization planning

### Code Review Panel (4 Agents)
1. **Code Reviewer** → Quality and maintainability analysis
2. **Security Auditor** → Vulnerability and compliance review
3. **Performance Engineer** → Efficiency and scalability assessment
4. **Test Engineer** → Coverage and testing strategy validation

**Parallel Execution Strategy:**
- Agents work simultaneously on different aspects
- Results are consolidated into comprehensive analysis
- Cross-agent validation ensures consistency
- Final synthesis provides actionable roadmap

**Usage Examples:**
- `/orchestrate-agents new payment system` → Full development pipeline
- `/orchestrate-agents security review` → Code review panel
- `/orchestrate-agents feature planning` → Product trinity pattern

**Advanced Features:**
- Agent communication protocols for collaboration
- Shared context management across agents
- Conflict resolution for contradictory recommendations
- Priority-based recommendation synthesis
