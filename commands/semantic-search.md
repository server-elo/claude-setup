# /semantic-search

Sucht nach Bedeutung, nicht nach Keywords. Findet Code der etwas Ã„hnliches macht.

## Usage
```bash
/semantic-search "code that validates email addresses"
/semantic-search "functions that transform data asynchronously"
/semantic-search "authentication logic"
```

## Prompt
```
Semantic code search for: "{{query}}"

**Not keyword search. Understand MEANING:**

1. **Intent Analysis:** What is the user looking for conceptually?
2. **Semantic Scan:** Read codebase and understand what each part DOES
3. **Similarity Match:** Find code that accomplishes similar goals
4. **Ranking:** Rank by semantic similarity, not text match

**Search Strategy:**
- Ignore variable names (focus on behavior)
- Understand patterns (e.g., "validation" might be regex, conditionals, or library calls)
- Find related concepts (auth â†’ login, session, token, jwt)
- Include near-misses that might be useful

**Output:**
```
