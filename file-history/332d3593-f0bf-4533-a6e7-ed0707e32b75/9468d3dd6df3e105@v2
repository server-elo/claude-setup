        self.session_chunks = []

    def add_exchange(self, user_msg, assistant_msg, context):
        # Build sentence-level graph with temporal + semantic edges
        # Capture turn-level, round-level, session-level associations

    def retrieve_relevant_context(self, current_query):
        # Graph-based retrieval instead of simple last-N messages
        # Returns multi-granularity context

- Reduces burden on response generation
- Pre-processes episodic memory with reasoning before storage
- Better than real-time reasoning for every query

**Implementation for Sofia:**
```python
# Instead of: Store raw conversation â†’ reason during retrieval
# DO: Reason during storage â†’ fast retrieval

class PREMem:
    def store_exchange(self, user_msg, assistant_msg):
        # Extract: entities, intents, context, relationships
        # Synthesize: summaries, key facts, user preferences
        # Index: for fast retrieval without re-reasoning

    def retrieve(self, query):
        # Simple lookup - reasoning already done at storage time
```

**Impact:** ðŸ”¥ **MEDIUM** - Faster response, better context understanding

## ðŸ”¬ RESEARCH INSIGHTS

### **Key Finding #1: Streaming is King**
The biggest latency bottleneck is TTS waiting for full sentence. VoXtream/SpeakStream solve this with **first-word streaming** - speaking while still generating.

### **Key Finding #2: Memory is Misunderstood**
Most systems (including current Sofia) use simple message lists. SGMem shows that **graph-based multi-granularity memory** is far superior for long conversations.

### **Key Finding #3: Pre-Reasoning Wins**
PREMem demonstrates that **reasoning during storage** is faster than reasoning during retrieval. Current Sofia does neither - upgrade opportunity.

### **Key Finding #4: Noise Matters**
WebRTC VAD works in quiet environments but fails in real hotel reception. **Tiny Noise-Robust VAD** designed specifically for noisy AIoT deployments.

### **Key Finding #5: German-Specific Models Help**
Generic multilingual models like Whisper work, but **fine-tuned wav2vec2-german** shows 10-20% better WER for German speech, especially dialects.
