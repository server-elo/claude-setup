# /refactor-suggest

SchlÃ¤gt Refactorings vor die ein Mensch nie sehen wÃ¼rde (cross-file patterns).

## Usage
```bash
/refactor-suggest
/refactor-suggest src/components/
```

## Prompt
```
Deep refactoring analysis: {{path}}

**What humans miss (but AI can see):**

**1. Scattered Responsibilities**
Find code doing the same thing in 5+ places
â†’ Suggest extraction + single source of truth

**2. Hidden Abstractions**
Find patterns that repeat but with slight variations
â†’ Suggest abstraction that handles all cases

**3. Implicit Coupling**
Find files that always change together
â†’ Suggest merging or making dependency explicit

**4. Dead Code Paths**
Find code that's never executed (trace from entry points)
â†’ Suggest removal

**5. Performance Patterns**
Find O(nÂ²) where O(n) is possible
Find repeated computations that could be cached
â†’ Suggest optimizations

**6. Type Inconsistencies**
Find places where types are converted back and forth
â†’ Suggest consistent types

**Output Format:**
