# üöÄ Installation Guide - Claude Code Autonomous Activation

## ‚úÖ System Components Created

All scripts are now in `~/.claude/system/`:
- ‚úÖ `claude-interceptor.sh` - Pattern matching & enforcement
- ‚úÖ `behavior-monitor.sh` - Daemon for compliance tracking
- ‚úÖ `self-improvement.sh` - Introspection & auto-optimization
- ‚úÖ `README.md` - Complete documentation

## üìä Test Results

Pattern matching is **WORKING**:

```bash
# Test 1: Error pattern
Input: "I have an error in my code"
Result: ‚úÖ DEBUG_MODE detected
Actions: Launch debugger agent, check knowledge base, generate 5 hypotheses

# Test 2: Search pattern
Input: "where is the authentication function"
Result: ‚úÖ SEMANTIC_SEARCH detected
Actions: Check code index first, use semantic search

# Test 3: Multiple patterns
Input: "ultrathink and implement new feature"
Result: ‚úÖ COMPLEX_TASK + MAX_POWER detected
Actions: TodoWrite tool, dispatch agents, full 16K output, parallel launch
```

Behavior monitor daemon: ‚úÖ **RUNNING** (PID: 97169)
Compliance score: ‚úÖ **100/100** (GOOD)

## üîß Integration Options

### Option 1: Automatic Shell Hook (RECOMMENDED)

Add to `~/.zshrc`:

```bash
# Claude Code Autonomous Activation Hook
claude() {
    # Capture user message
    local user_msg="$*"

    # Run interception (pre-response pattern matching)
    if [ -n "$user_msg" ]; then
        ~/.claude/system/claude-interceptor.sh "$user_msg" >/dev/null 2>&1

        # If enforcement active, remind Claude
        if [ -f ~/.claude/system/current_enforcement.txt ]; then
            echo "üéØ Pattern detected - See enforcement directives"
            cat ~/.claude/system/current_enforcement.txt
            echo ""
        fi
    fi

    # Run actual Claude Code
    command claude "$@"
}
```

Then reload:
```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

### Option 2: Manual Testing (No Integration)

Test without modifying Claude Code behavior:

```bash
# Test any message
~/.claude/system/claude-interceptor.sh "your message here"

# Check what enforcement would trigger
cat ~/.claude/system/current_enforcement.txt
```

### Option 3: Background Monitoring Only

Keep daemon running for compliance tracking:

```bash
# Daemon is already running
~/.claude/system/behavior-monitor.sh status

# View logs
tail -f ~/.claude/logs/violations.log
```

## üìà What You Get

### Before (Current State):
- ‚ùå CLAUDE.md rules are passive suggestions
- ‚ùå I have to consciously remember to follow them
- ‚ùå No automatic pattern matching
- ‚ùå No enforcement of behaviors
- ‚ùå No self-improvement loop

### After (With This System):
- ‚úÖ Automatic pattern detection from your messages
- ‚úÖ Pre-response enforcement directives
- ‚úÖ Real-time compliance monitoring
- ‚úÖ Violation tracking and alerts
- ‚úÖ Self-improvement cycles with auto-updates to CLAUDE.md
- ‚úÖ Execution graph analysis
- ‚úÖ Anomaly detection

---

## üéØ Usage Examples

### Example 1: Debugging
```bash
$ claude "My authentication is broken"

# System automatically:
‚Üí Detects "broken" pattern (DEBUG_MODE)
‚Üí Generates enforcement directive:
  - Launch debugger agent in parallel
  - Check knowledge base for similar bugs
  - Generate 5 hypotheses
‚Üí Claude sees the directive and follows it
```

### Example 2: Complex Implementation
```bash
$ claude "implement user authentication with OAuth"

# System automatically:
‚Üí Detects "implement" pattern (COMPLEX_TASK)
‚Üí Generates enforcement directive:
  - Use TodoWrite tool for tracking
  - Dispatch specialist agents
‚Üí Claude creates todo list and launches agents
```

### Example 3: Max Power Analysis
```bash
$ claude "ultrathink this performance issue"

# System automatically:
‚Üí Detects "ultrathink" + "performance" (MAX_POWER + PERFORMANCE_MODE)
‚Üí Generates enforcement directive:
  - Use full 16K token output
  - Launch performance engineer agent
  - Profile bottlenecks
  - Launch all relevant agents in parallel
```

## üìä Monitoring Dashboard

### View Current Status:
```bash
~/.claude/system/behavior-monitor.sh status
```

### View Real-Time Activity:
```bash
# Interceptions
tail -f ~/.claude/logs/interception.log

# Violations
tail -f ~/.claude/logs/violations.log

# Monitoring
tail -f ~/.claude/logs/behavior-monitor.log
```

### View Reports:
```bash
# Compliance score
cat ~/.claude/reports/compliance.json | jq

# Execution graph
cat ~/.claude/reports/execution-graph.json | jq
```

---

## üîÑ Self-Improvement Cycles

### Run Weekly:
```bash
# Full cycle: analyze ‚Üí improve ‚Üí apply
~/.claude/system/self-improvement.sh full

# Review suggestions
cat ~/.claude/reports/suggested-improvements.md

# Apply improvements to CLAUDE.md
# (Manual review recommended before applying)
```

### Automated (Future):
Add to crontab:
```bash
# Run every Sunday at 2am
0 2 * * 0 ~/.claude/system/self-improvement.sh full
```

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Daemon not running?
```bash
~/.claude/system/behavior-monitor.sh start
```

### Patterns not matching?
```bash
# Test manually
~/.claude/system/claude-interceptor.sh "test message"

# Check logs
tail -20 ~/.claude/logs/interception.log
```

### Want to stop monitoring?
```bash
~/.claude/system/behavior-monitor.sh stop
```

### Reset everything?
```bash
# Stop daemon
~/.claude/system/behavior-monitor.sh stop

# Clear logs
rm ~/.claude/logs/*.log

# Restart fresh
~/.claude/system/behavior-monitor.sh start
```

## üìö Research Foundation

This system implements concepts from:

1. **MI9 (arXiv:2508.03858)** - Runtime governance & interception
2. **AgentSight (arXiv:2508.02736)** - Real-time behavior monitoring
3. **SentinelAgent (arXiv:2505.24201)** - Autonomous runtime monitoring
4. **Enforcement Agents (arXiv:2504.04070)** - Policy enforcement
5. **RISE (arXiv:2407.18219)** - Recursive introspection
6. **SEAL (arXiv:2506.10943)** - Self-adaptation

## ‚ú® Next Steps

### 1. Choose Integration Level:

**Full Power (Recommended):**
- Add shell hook to `~/.zshrc`
- Daemon runs continuously
- Self-improvement cycles weekly

**Medium Power:**
- Daemon runs continuously
- No shell hook (patterns checked manually)

**Low Power:**
- Run daemon only when needed
- Manual testing of patterns

### 2. Test It:

```bash
# Try each pattern type
claude "I have an error"           # DEBUG_MODE
claude "where is main.py"          # SEMANTIC_SEARCH
claude "implement new feature"     # COMPLEX_TASK
claude "optimize performance"      # PERFORMANCE_MODE
claude "check security"            # SECURITY_MODE
claude "ultrathink the problem"    # MAX_POWER
```

### 3. Monitor Results:

```bash
# Watch compliance score
watch -n 60 ~/.claude/system/behavior-monitor.sh status

# Track violations
tail -f ~/.claude/logs/violations.log
```

### 4. Iterate:

```bash
# Weekly improvement cycle
~/.claude/system/self-improvement.sh full
cat ~/.claude/reports/suggested-improvements.md
```
