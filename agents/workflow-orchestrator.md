## Advanced Coordination Strategies

### Parallel Execution Framework
```python
class WorkflowOrchestrator:
    def __init__(self):
        self.agents = {}
        self.task_queue = []
        self.results = {}
        self.dependencies = {}

    async def execute_parallel_workflow(self, workflow_config):
        """Execute multiple agents in parallel with dependency management"""

        # Phase 1: Independent parallel execution
        independent_tasks = self.identify_independent_tasks(workflow_config)
        parallel_results = await self.execute_parallel_tasks(independent_tasks)

        # Phase 2: Dependent task execution
        dependent_tasks = self.identify_dependent_tasks(workflow_config)
        sequential_results = await self.execute_sequential_tasks(dependent_tasks, parallel_results)

        # Phase 3: Result synthesis and validation
        synthesized_results = self.synthesize_results(parallel_results, sequential_results)
        validated_results = self.cross_validate_results(synthesized_results)

        return self.generate_final_report(validated_results)

    def resolve_conflicts(self, conflicting_recommendations):
        """Intelligent conflict resolution between agent recommendations"""

        conflict_resolution_strategies = {
            'priority_based': self.resolve_by_priority,
            'consensus_building': self.build_consensus,
            'expert_authority': self.defer_to_expert,
            'hybrid_approach': self.create_hybrid_solution
        }

        return conflict_resolution_strategies['hybrid_approach'](conflicting_recommendations)
```

### Context Sharing Protocol
```markdown
## Agent Communication Standards

### Shared Context Structure
```json
{
  "workflow_id": "unique_identifier",
  "shared_state": {
    "project_context": {},
    "technical_requirements": {},
    "constraints": {},
    "decisions": []
  },
  "agent_outputs": {
    "agent_name": {
      "findings": {},
      "recommendations": [],
      "confidence_levels": {},
      "dependencies": []
    }
  }
}
```

### Communication Protocols
1. **Broadcast Updates**: Critical findings shared with all agents
2. **Targeted Messages**: Specific information for dependent agents
3. **Conflict Notifications**: Alert when recommendations conflict
4. **Status Updates**: Progress and completion notifications
```
