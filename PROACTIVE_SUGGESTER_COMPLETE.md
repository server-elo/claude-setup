## Signal Analysis System

### 1. Time Patterns (analyze_time_patterns)
```bash
# Detects what user does at specific times/days
- Historical command timing analysis
- Project preferences by hour/day
- Work session patterns
- Output: "time_pattern:project_name:hour"
```

### 2. Command Sequences (analyze_command_sequences)
```bash
# Identifies repeated command pairs
- Finds commands that follow each other
- Frequency counting (3+ occurrences)
- Automation opportunity detection
- Output: "sequence:cmd1 → cmd2:count"
```

### 3. Project Health (analyze_project_health)
```bash
# Monitors project status
- Git uncommitted changes
- Missing virtual environments
- Dependency issues
- Output: "uncommitted:project:count" or "missing_venv:project:priority"
```

### 4. Git Intelligence (analyze_git_intelligence)
```bash
# Advanced git analysis
- Behind/ahead commit tracking
- Stash detection
- Branch status
- Output: "git_behind:branch:count", "git_ahead:branch:count", "git_stashes:count:action"
```

### 5. Error Patterns (analyze_error_patterns)
```bash
# Recurring error detection
- Failed command tracking
- Module not found errors
- Venv-related issues (pip without venv)
- Output: "error_pattern:command:count", "venv_issue:type:count"
```

### 6. File Modifications (analyze_file_modifications)
```bash
# Recent edit tracking
- Files modified in last 2 hours
- Language-specific (py, js, go, rs)
- Test suggestion triggers
- Output: "recent_edits:file_list"
```

## Confidence Scoring Algorithm

### Base Scores
```javascript
{
  "git_uncommitted": 80,    // +10 if count > 10
  "missing_venv": 85,
  "git_behind": 90,
  "git_ahead": 85,
  "venv_warning": 88,
  "command_sequence": 70,
  "test_suggestion": 72,
  "time_pattern": 75,
  "sofia_pattern": 82
}
```

### Adjustments
```bash
# Historical acceptance rate
if acceptance_rate > 0:
    confidence += (acceptance_rate / 10)  # Max +10

# Priority boost
if priority == "high": confidence += 5
if priority == "low": confidence -= 5

# Time relevance (work hours 9-18)
if work_hours: confidence += 3

# Cap at 100
confidence = min(confidence, 100)
```

### Filtering
```bash
# Only show suggestions with confidence > 70%
filtered = suggestions.filter(s => s.confidence > 70)

# Rank by confidence (descending)
ranked = filtered.sort_by(confidence, desc)

# Return top 10
return ranked.slice(0, 10)
```

## Usage Examples

### Generate Suggestions
```bash
$ ~/.claude/scripts/proactive-suggester.sh analyze

[88%] sofia-pers has 5 uncommitted changes
   → cd ~/Desktop/elvi/sofia-pers && git status

[85%] Python project local-voice-ai-agent missing virtual environment
   → cd ~/Desktop/elvi/sofia-pers/local-voice-ai-agent && python3 -m venv .venv

[75%] You often work on sofia-pers at this time
   → cd ~/Desktop/elvi/sofia-pers
```

### Execute Proactive Actions
```bash
$ ~/.claude/scripts/proactive-suggester.sh proactive

proactive_action:venv_activate:/Users/tolga/Desktop/elvi/sofia-pers/.venv
proactive_action:morning_review:git status && git log -3
proactive_warning:pip_without_venv:Activate venv first
proactive_suggestion:commit_before_switch:5 files uncommitted
```

### Record Feedback
```bash
# User accepted suggestion
$ ~/.claude/scripts/proactive-suggester.sh feedback git_uncommitted true
Feedback recorded: git_uncommitted → true

# User rejected suggestion
$ ~/.claude/scripts/proactive-suggester.sh feedback command_sequence false
Feedback recorded: command_sequence → false
```

- Daemon integration code: ✅
- Testing: ✅
- Documentation: ✅
- **Manual merge required**: See `/tmp/daemon-integration.txt`

### Integration Steps

1. **Add function to V3 daemon** (`~/.claude/scripts/v3-autonomous-daemon.sh`):
```bash
# Run proactive suggestion engine
run_proactive_suggester() {
    log "🔮 Running proactive suggestion engine..."

    # Generate suggestions
    local suggestions=$(~/.claude/scripts/proactive-suggester.sh analyze 2>/dev/null)

    if [ -n "$suggestions" ] && [ "$suggestions" != "No high-confidence suggestions at this time." ]; then
        log "💡 SUGGESTIONS:"
        echo "$suggestions" | while IFS= read -r line; do
            [ -n "$line" ] && log "   $line"
        done

        # Record in state
        local timestamp=$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)
        jq ".suggestions_made += [{\"timestamp\": \"$timestamp\", \"count\": 1}]" "$STATE" > /tmp/state.json && mv /tmp/state.json "$STATE"
    fi

    # Execute proactive actions
    local actions=$(~/.claude/scripts/proactive-suggester.sh proactive 2>/dev/null)
    if [ -n "$actions" ]; then
        echo "$actions" | while IFS= read -r action; do
            if [ -n "$action" ]; then
                log "⚡ AUTO-ACTION: $action"
                jq ".actions_taken += [\"$action\"]" "$STATE" > /tmp/state.json && mv /tmp/state.json "$STATE"
            fi
        done
    fi
}
```

2. **Add to autonomous loop** (after `monitor_errors`):
```bash
autonomous_loop() {
    # ... existing code ...

    while true; do
        CYCLE=$((CYCLE + 1))
        jq ".cycles = $CYCLE" "$STATE" > /tmp/state.json && mv /tmp/state.json "$STATE"

        monitor_git
        predict_next_action
        monitor_errors
        run_proactive_suggester  # <-- ADD THIS LINE
        proactive_health_check

        sleep 60
    done
}
```

3. **Restart daemon**:
```bash
~/.claude/scripts/v3-autonomous-daemon.sh stop
~/.claude/scripts/v3-autonomous-daemon.sh start
```

### Expected Daemon Output
```
[2025-09-30 19:15:00] 🚀 V3 Autonomous Daemon started (PID: 12345)

## Real-World Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Prevent Lost Work
**Time**: User about to switch from sofia-pers to quantum
**Detection**: 5 uncommitted files in sofia-pers
**Action**: "Commit before switching? 5 files uncommitted"
**Confidence**: 90%
**Outcome**: User commits → work saved

### Scenario 2: Error Prevention
**Time**: User runs `pip install numpy`
**Detection**: No venv activated, pattern of venv errors
**Action**: "⚠️ Activate venv first: source .venv/bin/activate"
**Confidence**: 95%
**Outcome**: User activates venv → no ModuleNotFoundError

### Scenario 3: Workflow Optimization
**Time**: User runs `cd sofia-pers && ./start_sofia.sh` (6th time)
**Detection**: Command sequence repeated
**Action**: "Create alias? sofia-run='cd ~/Desktop/elvi/sofia-pers && ./start_sofia.sh'"
**Confidence**: 82%
**Outcome**: User accepts → 5 seconds saved per run

### Scenario 4: Context Pre-Loading
**Time**: 19:00 (evening), typical sofia-pers work time
**Detection**: Historical pattern (last 10 days)
**Action**: "Pre-loading sofia-pers context..."
**Confidence**: 85%
**Outcome**: When user opens project, context ready

### Scenario 5: Test Reminder
**Time**: User edited 3 Python files in last hour
**Detection**: File modification tracking
**Action**: "3 files modified - run tests? pytest tests/"
**Confidence**: 72%
**Outcome**: User runs tests → catches bug before commit

## Advanced Features

### Sofia Project Intelligence
```bash
# Specific to sofia-pers projects
- Console script detection
- Voice AI health checks
- Audio device validation
- Frequent command aliases
```

### Multi-Project Tracking
```bash
# Simultaneous monitoring
- 12+ projects tracked
- Cross-project patterns
- Resource sharing detection
- Project switching optimization
```

### Temporal Intelligence
```bash
# Time-aware suggestions
- Morning: Review uncommitted changes
- Afternoon: Test reminders
- Evening: Commit work in progress
- Weekend: Maintenance tasks
```

## Configuration

### Confidence Threshold
```bash
# Default: 70% (in generate_suggestions function)
local filtered=$(echo "$ranked" | jq '[.[] | select(.confidence > 70)]')

# To change: Edit line 345 in proactive-suggester.sh
# Lower = more suggestions (may be noise)
# Higher = fewer, high-quality suggestions
```

### Suggestion Frequency
```bash
# Default: 60 seconds (in v3-autonomous-daemon.sh)
sleep 60

# To change: Edit autonomous_loop in daemon
# More frequent = more responsive, higher CPU
# Less frequent = lower overhead, delayed detection
```

### Priority Weights
```bash
# In rank_suggestions function
case "$priority" in
    high) confidence=$((confidence + 5)) ;;
    low) confidence=$((confidence - 5)) ;;
esac

# Adjust these values to change importance
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: No suggestions shown
**Cause**: Confidence scores below 70%
**Fix**: Run with debug: `bash -x ~/.claude/scripts/proactive-suggester.sh analyze`

### Issue: Integer expression errors
**Cause**: Empty count values in git analysis
**Fix**: Already patched in line 200 (clean count value)

### Issue: Duplicate suggestions
**Cause**: Multiple signal sources detecting same issue
**Fix**: Deduplication logic in generate_suggestions (TODO: can be enhanced)

### Issue: Suggestions not in dashboard
**Cause**: Dashboard not updated
**Fix**: Run dashboard update: `~/.claude/scripts/dashboard.sh`

## Future Enhancements

### Phase 2 (Short Term)
- [ ] Natural language query support
- [ ] Integration with Claude Code directly
- [ ] Voice notifications (for sofia projects)
- [ ] Slack/Discord webhooks

### Phase 3 (Medium Term)
- [ ] ML-based pattern detection
- [ ] Cross-user learning (opt-in)
- [ ] Predictive task scheduling
- [ ] Resource usage optimization

### Phase 4 (Long Term)
- [ ] Full autonomy (no confirmation needed)
- [ ] Multi-agent coordination
- [ ] Self-healing systems
- [ ] Proactive bug prevention
