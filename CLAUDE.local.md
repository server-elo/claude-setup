# CLAUDE.local.md - Personal Workspace Notes

This file contains personal workspace notes and is typically gitignored. It tracks local development state and personal preferences for this specific project.

## Current Session Notes
- Started comprehensive Claude Code optimization on 2025-01-09
- Successfully installed GitHub and Filesystem MCPs
- Working through systematic implementation plan

## Personal Reminders
- Focus on practical, working solutions over experimental features
- Test each MCP server before moving to the next
- Document any issues encountered for future reference

## Local Development State
### Working Features
- ✅ GitHub MCP: Repository operations, PR management
- ✅ Filesystem MCP: Advanced file operations

### Issues Encountered
- ❌ Memory Keeper MCP: Failed to connect (connection timeout)
- ❌ Claude Context MCP: Failed to connect (may need specific setup)

### Next Actions
1. Try alternative memory MCPs or implement manual memory system
2. Install SQLite MCP for local database operations
3. Create Code Reviewer subagent
4. Set up basic lifecycle hooks

## Personal Configuration Preferences
- Prefer SQLite over PostgreSQL for this configuration project
- Focus on official MCPs first, then community ones
- Keep documentation updated as we progress

## Learning Notes
- MCP servers need proper npm packages and may require specific environment setup
- Some community MCPs may not be production-ready
- Official Anthropic MCPs are more reliable
- The 3-tier memory system provides good context separation

## Quick Commands
```bash
# Check MCP status
claude mcp list

# Test if Claude can access this file
cat CLAUDE.local.md
```
